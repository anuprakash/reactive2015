On the client, Falcor makes it appear as if the entire JSON model is available locally and allows you to access data the same way you would from an in-memory JSON object. Falcor retrieves the model data you request from the cloud on-demand, transparently handling all the network communication and keeping the server and client in sync.  Falcor is not a replacement for your MVC framework, your database, or your application server. Falcor fits seamlessly into your existing stack and lets the layers communicate more efficiently.

However, to achieve perfect real-time experience one also needs to synchronize server data with client data. Unfortunately the nowadays widely used REST-like API is rather suited to one-time fetches, usually resulting in stale client data. Reactive databases such as Firebase seek to be the solution to this problem. I will show how Firebase can be integrated with React (spoiler alert: it can be done in a beautiful way) to get what-you-see-is-what-it-really-is kind of UX and how the FLUX pattern helps us to keep database updates clean. Since Firebase-like databases are quite fresh and immature, you may get an inspiration for a nice Friday-night project here.'

I want to share my experience working with an amazing team on this free resource.  First, I\'ll give a quick tour of what\'s possible with the Playground, showing off some of React Native itself. We\'ll see how React Native’s unique architecture made this project possible, revealing some interesting details of its inner workings. For example, how we\'re serving React Native javascript code over the web, and how we can load an application from inside another one.

What gets easier in that world? What gets harder? What would that mean for debugging? Testing? We don\'t have to wonder about these things, because this world already exists — and it compiles to JavaScript. It\'s the world of Elm, where there are no side effects, all functions are stateless, and all data is immutable. Elm embraces the concepts that make reactive programming great, and goes one step further to shed the error‐prone mutations and side effects that so often lead to incidental complexity and buggy code. NoRedInk has reaped the benefits of this approach since they began using Elm in production earlier in 2015. It\'s helped them scale and maintain a complex front-end code base that students use to answer millions of questions per day. Come see how refreshing this world can be!'

      excerpt: 'Engineers with experience using React for web coming who dive into mobile will feel at home quickly because the basic React API doesn\'t change. But building for mobile introduces a different way of thinking about the software that you create and React Native empowers you to embrace this rather than attempt to hide it from you: your primary mode of interaction is touch, animations are more common and are expected to be smooth and dynamically track your gestures, you actually have to think about how your app will handle offline / poor connectivity, what happens when the user backgrounds it and comes back, how to send push/local notifications and respond to them, how to stay at 60fps performance on a much less capable device with more demanding users, responding to the keyboard appearing and hiding - specifying different keyboard types, autocorrect/autocomplete, dealing with device orientation changes and status bar changes, app store deployment delays and more. I won\'t go into great detail about each of these points but will rather help you to build a mental map of the space and touch on solutions that React Native provides to handle these mobile-specific problems, in order for unknown unknowns can become known unknowns. So this talk is kind of to React Native what a maphack is to Starcraft, but totally not lame like that.'
